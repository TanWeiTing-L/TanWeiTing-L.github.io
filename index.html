            <p>In todayâ€™s interconnected world, personal information is a valuable commodity. Cybercriminals often target sensitive data, such as passwords, bank account details, and social security numbers, to commit fraud or identity theft. Sharing too much personal information online, whether on social media platforms or unsecured websites, can make you vulnerable to these threats. Always think before you share, use strong and unique passwords, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible to keep your information safe.</p>

Phishing scams often trick users into providing personal details by posing as legitimate companies or individuals. Malware can infect your devices, leading to data loss or compromised systems. Being able to recognize these threats is crucial for avoiding them. Stay alert to suspicious emails, verify website authenticity, and ensure your devices have up-to-date antivirus protection.</p>
